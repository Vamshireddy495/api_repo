## How to Use This List

- **Beginners**: Start with problems 1–30 to build a strong foundation in Python syntax, loops, conditionals, and basic functions.
- **Intermediate**: Tackle problems 31–80 to gain experience with data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees), algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion), and Pandas for data manipulation.
- **Advanced**: Solve problems 81–120 to prepare for coding interviews, focusing on dynamic programming, graph algorithms, and advanced Pandas tasks.
- **Practice Strategy**:
  - Solve problems in order to build skills progressively.
  - Write clean, efficient code and test edge cases (e.g., empty inputs, large inputs).
  - For Pandas problems, use sample datasets (e.g., CSV files or dictionaries) to test your solutions.
  - If preparing for interviews, practice explaining your solution aloud to simulate a whiteboard session.
  - Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or Kaggle for additional practice with similar problems.
- **Pandas Tips**:
  - Ensure you have Pandas installed (`pip install pandas`).
  - Test Pandas solutions with small, manageable datasets before scaling up.
  - Refer to Pandas documentation for functions like `groupby`, `merge`, or `pivot_table`.

## Notes
- These problems assume familiarity with Python syntax. If you’re new, consider learning basics (variables, loops, functions) first.
- For problems involving data structures like linked lists or trees, you may need to implement helper classes (e.g., `Node` for linked lists or trees).
- Pandas problems assume basic knowledge of DataFrames, filtering, grouping, and joins. Practice with sample datasets to solidify understanding.
- If you’d like sample solutions or code for any specific problem, request them, and I can provide Python implementations.
- For visualization (e.g., plotting Pandas DataFrame results or algorithm performance), request charts with specific data and chart types.
